She has experience in working with multidisciplinary research action which integrates diverse areas in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Gender inclusion and policies, leadership in STEMI, environment, health, social and business areas. She has won several grants, awards and scholarships. One of the grants is the Data for Local Impact (DLi) Innovation Challenge also known as DREAMS WINDOW which was funded by The President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) through Data for Local Impact Innovation Challenge at CoSTECH in Tanzania. In this award she developed an innovative tool called Early Warning-Dropout Visualisation Tool (EDV-Tool) and an NGO (BintiShule). The aim of the tool is to address the problem of data-collection, on-time-data-submission and effective data analysis, prediction through the use of Machine Learning, presentation and visualisation from grassroots(schools-village-ward-district) to higher-levels in order to prevent and reduce drop-out and its related risks such as early pregnancies, HIV/AIDS, WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene), and cultural practices especially among girls; The tool deployed emerging-technologies which are cheap to operate, understandable and also, sustainable. Whereas the NGO is in-line with the EDV-Tool whose aim is to empower, encourage and educate girls on the importance of getting education, measures to take during menstruation and to follow in order to avoid early pregnancies, HIV/AIDS-risk-behaviour and bad-cultural practices. Dr. Leo’s Master’s research title was, \"An Interactive Remote Doctor Consultation Registration system for Acquisition of Geo-Information in order to Enhance Epidemiological Analysis: A Case of Tanzania\". It involved the integration of Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), System Development and Integration using both health and environmental data. Whereas, the PhD research area has focused on modelling health and environmental data with a title of “ARPM: Adaptive Reference Machine Learning (ML) Model for Prediction of Cholera Epidemics based-on Seasonal Weather Changes Linkages in Tanzania.  \r\n\r\nAddition, Dr. Leo has been mentoring and supervising Master’s and Ph.D. students in the School of Computational and Communication Science and Engineering (COCSE) and co-supervise with other lecturers in the Schools of Materials, Energy and Water Engineering (MEWES), and Life Science and BioEngineering (LiSBE): https://nm-aist.ac.tz/index.php/schools.
